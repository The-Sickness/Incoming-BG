1. Solo Shuffle Rating with Delay Timer
I implemented a mechanism to fetch and display the Solo Shuffle Rating in your PvP stats frame. Here's what I did:

Delayed Data Fetching: I used C_Timer.After() to introduce a delay of 2 seconds before fetching the Solo Shuffle rating. This delay ensures that the necessary game data is fully loaded and available, especially since accessing this information immediately upon login or UI load might result in incomplete data.
Dynamic Update: The rating is dynamically updated in the PvP stats frame whenever the relevant data becomes available. This update occurs in response to specific game events or when the player manually checks their PvP stats.
2. Resolution of Chat Message Limit Issues
I addressed a problem related to exceeding the chat message limit by optimizing how messages are queued and sent:

Message Queueing: Improved the system for queueing messages to ensure that messages are sent out at intervals that respect the game's rate limits, thus avoiding the issue where too many messages would trigger warnings or blocks.
Efficient Handling: Adjusted the code to better manage the frequency of messages, especially in scenarios where multiple events might trigger a burst of messages. This included implementing controls to space out messages appropriately.
Technical Details of the Fixes:
For Solo Shuffle Rating:
I ensured that the addon waits for the Blizzard PvP UI to load properly and for the data to be fetched with a slight delay, which is crucial right after logging in or when switching characters.
For Chat Message Limits:
I refined the logic that handles the sending of chat messages, particularly for functions tied to events that could generate multiple messages in quick succession, by implementing a queueing system that sends messages at a set interval rather than all at once.

The "PVP Stats" button is a cool new feature in the "Incoming-BG" addon for World of Warcraft, designed specifically for PvP enthusiasts. When you click this button, it pops open a slick new window right in the middle of your screen, showcasing all your PvP stats in one spot.
 You can check out how many honorable kills you've racked up over your career, see your highest PvP rank, and keep tabs on your current Conquest and Honor Points. It even displays your Honor Level, so you can easily gauge your progress in the PvP scene.

Dynamic Color Customization for UI Elements:

Introduced functionality allowing users to dynamically change the color of the addon's title logo through user settings. This involved manipulating the SetVertexColor method to adjust the RGBA values based on user preferences stored in an AceDB profile.
Error Handling in Automated Chat Messaging:

Resolved Lua errors encountered when attempting to use SendChatMessage by ensuring the addon checks for proper group and instance context. This was achieved by verifying the player's group status and instance type before executing chat commands, preventing errors related to invalid message channels.
Persistent UI Settings Across Sessions:

Addressed issues with UI elements (buttons, text) not retaining their customized settings after a UI reload or relog. This involved correctly saving user preferences to the AceDB profile and applying these settings through event handlers triggered by the ADDON_LOADED and PLAYER_LOGIN events.
Enhanced User Customization Options:

Expanded the addon's customization capabilities to include not only the logo color but also the text and button colors. Implemented AceConfig options for these settings, providing a GUI interface for user adjustments. Additionally, provided an option to hide the logo for users preferring a minimalistic design.
Context-Sensitive UI Visibility:

Refined the logic for showing or hiding the addon UI based on the player's current environment, particularly focusing on PvP instances. Leveraged the IsInInstance API call to determine the addon's visibility state, ensuring it aligns with the player's presence in PvP or PvE content.
Code Optimization and Streamlining:

Performed code refactoring to remove redundant or obsolete code paths, optimizing event handling and state management. This involved consolidating event listeners and streamlining the execution flow to reduce overhead and improve performance.
Bug Fixes and Error Resolution:

Conducted thorough debugging to identify and resolve various issues affecting the addon's functionality and user experience. This included addressing Lua errors, fixing logical errors in event handling, and ensuring consistent application of user preferences.
