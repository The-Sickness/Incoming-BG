The MUST-HAVE addon for calling INC's in Battlegrounds, Rated BG's, Brawls, And Rated Brawls, (soon to be SRBG's)

 

* Have even been in a situation in a BG or Epic BG to where you don't have time to type out that there is an INC at your location/flag? Stopping to type out your message for your group will take away from you defending the flag. 

 

* Playing any type of PVP is usually fast paced and there isn't room for mistakes. Taking time to type things out takes too much time to do. Well this addon will make it to where you do NOT have to type anything to call out an INC. All you have to do is click on the appropriate button to call out the INC for you. 

 

Here is some info on the GUI: There is only one GUI. There is no need to configure anything, unless you want to choose different messages besides the default ones. You don't have to configure what battleground you are in, my addon does that for you based on your location. My addon will call an INC or whatever message you want based on where you are in the battleground. There is nothing that you as a player has to do with configuration. All you gotta do is click the appropriate button in whatever situation you are in. Rather it's a INC, All Clear, Zerg, or whatever, all you gotta do is click a button..... 

 

The Conquest and Honor tabs are at the bottom of the GUI. Both of these can be edited for color, font, and size. Both Conquest and Honor will update in real time. It's just a convenient way to see your points if you don't have them listed in another DataBroker addon that lets them be visible at all times. 

 

The Healer Button will announce to your team members who are the healers for your team in Instance-Chat. That lets team members know who to peel for, or not. 

The H.M.D. (Healers Must Die) button has 10 different messages you can choose from that will target enemy healers. It reminds your team mates that Healers Must Die.....
